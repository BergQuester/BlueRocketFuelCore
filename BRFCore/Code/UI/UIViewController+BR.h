 Extensions to UIViewController for app support.
 
 This category will make all UIViewController objects support all properties defined in the global shared @c BRServiceRegistry
 available as read-write properties directly, unless the controller directly implements a similar property. This makes it very
 easy access to application services in view controllers, by simply adding a @c \@dynamic property for the desired service.

/**
 Ajust the layout of a view in response to a keyboard showing event.
 
 Generally you call this method in one of two ways: first, with a @c UIScrollView as the @c refView, and @c nil @c intersectView and @c constraint properties.
 Second, with @c intersectView and @c constraint and some regular view for @c refView. This allows for a single view controller to handle different layouts,
 such as a scroll view on iPhone while a normal view on iPad.
 
 @param notification  The keyboard hide event.
 @param refView       The reference container view. This should generally be the view controller's @c view or a @c UIScrollView.
 @param intersectView If @c refView is @b not a @c UIScrollView, the view to use when calculating how much the keyboard overlaps with.
 @param constraint    If @c refView is @b not a @c UIScrollView, the constraint to adjust according to how much the keyboard overlaps with @c intersectView.
